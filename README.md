OrganizeMusic was created to pull the music from an iPod Classic and store them in a more familiar format (/artist/album/song.mp3)

For context:
  iPod classics store their music in a hidden folder and then hash the titles.
  The id3 tags remain intact but it isn't in a structure friendly to the users.
